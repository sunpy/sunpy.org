=============
SunPy Project
=============

The **SunPy Project** is the organization which maintains the SunPy library and sponsored affiliated packages.
Its primary goal is to *facilitate and promote the use and development of a community-led, free and open-source solar data-analysis software based on the scientific Python environment*.

The organization is described in `SEP-2`_, and consists of a group of trusted community members the "Project Custodians", a three person "Steering Committee" who manage the project day-to-day, and an Advisory Board who provide oversight and guidance.

**Everyone is encouraged to participate in the SunPy Project.**

People
------

In this section we list everyone with a specific role in the project, all the members of the development community are too numerous to list here.
A list of anyone who contributed code to the SunPy Project is available on Github `contributors`_ and for each major release we keep track of who contributed in-between `releases`_.
