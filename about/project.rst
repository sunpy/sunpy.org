=============
SunPy Project
=============

The **SunPy Project** is the organization which maintains the SunPy library and sponsored affiliated packages.
Its primary goal is to *facilitate and promote the use and development of a community-led, free and open-source solar data-analysis software based on the scientific Python environment*.

The organization is described in `SEP-2`_, and consists of the Project Custodians, a Steering Committee appointed by the Project Custodians, an advisory board, with community roles supported by developers who contribute to any package under the organization.

**Everyone is encouraged to participate in the SunPy Project.**

The goal of the Steering Committee is to lead the overall structure and direction of the SunPy Project while the lead developer works with the developer community to implement it.
The Advisory Board publicly posts the `minutes`_ from each of their meetings.

.. _minutes: https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/wiki/Home%3A-Organization-Information

The project governance was significantly updated on 16-May-2024 via a heavily changed `SEP-2`_.
This page will be updated as those changes are implemented.

People
------

In this section we list everyone with a specific role in the project, all the members of the development community are too numerous to list here.
A list of anyone who contributed code to the SunPy Project is available on Github `contributors`_ and for each major release we keep track of who contributed in-between `releases`_.

Maintainers
^^^^^^^^^^^

The following section list the individuals who extend or maintain various aspects of the SunPy Project that are not covered by the above roles.
These are people who maintain a submodule of ``sunpy`` or who maintain a separate package that under the control of the SunPy Project.
These people might also *lead* development of their specific domain.

We are always looking for people to join the SunPy Project to ensure we continue to provide the best possible set of libraries to the solar physics community.
If you would like to get involved please get in touch.
