Lightning Talks
---------------
Lightning talks are short (5–7 minute) presentations from members of the SunPy community,
designed to highlight new tools, projects, ideas, or even open questions.
They’re a great way to share your work, spark discussion, and connect with others working in similar areas.

The exact timing of each talk will be confirmed soon and posted in the final agenda.
