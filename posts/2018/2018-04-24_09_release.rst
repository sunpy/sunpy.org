The SunPy project is very happy to announce the release of SunPy 0.9, the latest
release of the SunPy core package.

SunPy 0.9 brings improved support for downloading data from the JSOC and
bugfixes compared to the 0.8.x series of releases. The 0.9.x series will be the
last series of SunPy releases to support Python 2. This is because Python 2
will not be maintained after 2019. The 0.9.x
series will receive bugfixs only up until the and of life of Python 2 (around 18
months). No new functionality will be added to the 0.9.x series, which will also
be the last version to include `sunpy.spectra`, `sunpy.lightcurve` and
`sunpy.wcs`, all of which were deprecated in 0.8.

SunPy 1.0 and higher will support Python 3 only. All new
functionality will be available only in SunPy 1.0 and higher.

SunPy v0.9.0 contains 807 commits in 147 merged pull requests closing 310
issues from 31 people, 19 of which are first time contributors to SunPy.
