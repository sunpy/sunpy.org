SunPy 0.7 has arrived!
This release is a culmination of about 10 months of work from 27 different people.
This release brings many `changes <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/blob/0.7/CHANGELOG.md>`_, the highlights are:

* Python 3.4 and 3.5 support. This is the first version of SunPy to support
  Python 3, we recommend that users start to consider moving to Python 3, please
  report any issues you may have.
* New coordinate framework. The new ``sunpy.coordinates`` module provides a
  high-level interface to converting between different physical coordinate
  systems such as Helioprojective and Heliographic.
* New ``draw_rectangle`` and ``draw_contours`` helpers for ``Map``.
* Support for masks in SunPy ``Map`` and ``MapCube``.

For this version of SunPy we have started building our `conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_ packages on the excellent `conda forge <http://conda-forge.github.io>`_ service.
This means you need to add the conda-forge channel to your conda installation.
If you have never installed SunPy before we recommend you follow our `installation instruction <http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/installation>`_.
If you are upgrading from a previous release run the following two commands if you installed via ``conda``:

::

	conda config --add channels conda-forge
	conda upgrade sunpy

If you installed via ``pip`` then you can upgrade with:

::

	pip install -U sunpy
