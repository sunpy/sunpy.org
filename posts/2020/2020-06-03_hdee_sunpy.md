# SunPy awarded a NASA HDEE Grant

A NASA Heliophysics Data Environment Enhancement (HDEE) grant has been
awarded to a proposal submitted to support SunPy development. The
grant was awarded through NASA's 2019 ROSES grant solicitation.

The grant supports the following development goals:

- Creation of a report on the state of the SunPy codebase by analyzing
  output from code coverage and API inspection tools, etc, identifying
  areas in the existing codebase that need more coverage, can be
  consolidated or removed.
- Provide the ability to read spectroscopic data into a spectral data
  object, thereby enabling its later scientific analysis.
- Implement a number of heliophysical coordinate systems using the
  existing SunPy and Astropy-based coordinate system framework.
- Create example code snippets that use SunPy and packages from the
  Python in Heliophysics Community; these examples will be shared via
  the Python in Heliophysics Community.

The PI of the grant is Jack Ireland, and the co-I of the grant is Andy
Terrel (NumFOCUS). The grant has a one year duration. The bulk of
the code development will be undertaken by a developer hired through
NuMFOCUS. We look forward to supporting the development of SunPy
through this grant.
