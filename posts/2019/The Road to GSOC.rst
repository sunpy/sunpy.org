We have been taught from our childhoods that nothing can be earned
without toiling hard, to achieve something we need to sacrifice
something. The same mantra applies to Google Summer of Code or as we
fondly know it, GSOC.

I am a second-year student of the Indian Institute of Technology,
Bhubaneswar and am selected in the Summer of Code project on *Developing
Sunkit Image,* a solar image processing library in Python. This
project is hosted by **Sunpy,** under **Open Astronomy.** This blog
post is written to serve as a guide to future applicants, who find
themselves overwhelmed by GSOC. Most of us (engineering students) in
India have heard about Google’s flagship programme for college students,
the **Summer Of Code.** I too was a part of the same herd, having
ambitions to be a part of the programme but with no proper plans and
knowledge.

Getting into it requires proper planning and execution. There are a few
major steps involved —

-  Selection of the project
-  Interactions with the community
-  Completing the stipulated prerequisite tasks
-  Drafting a good proposal
-  Getting feedback on the proposal from the members of the organization
-  Rewriting it!! (Very important)
-  Finally, hoping that luck favours you.

**Selecting the project**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choosing the project which is **right for you** is very important.
Always choose something that intrigues you rather than doing something
just because others are doing it. I chose *sunkit image* because it
combined both my interest in image processing and my love for astronomy.
But finding a particular project in the vast ocean of projects is a
tedious task.

I started exploring the organizations even before they were officially
announced. I looked at the organizations who have been a part of GSOC
for the past years as they were more likely to be present the next year
too. After much digging, I found sunkit-image in Sunpy.

**Tip:** *If you like a particular organization explore their GSOC
webpages way before the projects are officially announced. This is
because most organizations list their projects on their website before
sending it to Google.*

Initiate Contact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contact the organization and the mentors as early as possible. Be formal
in your conversations and follow every rules or guideline for
interaction as listed on the website. Don’t be timid and shy and ask
them questions if you stuck somewhere.

Prerequisite Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is very important that you fulfil all the criteria of selection for
an organization. Most of the organizations ask you to open a pull
request to judge your coding skills, make sure that you write that PR
well enough. It is your only chance to impress your mentors with your
work. Get feedback on your work and refine it to suit the needs of the
problem.

Proposal
~~~~~~~~

The proposal is the thing which highlights what you have done till now
and what you want to do ahead. Take time in writing it. Follow the
organization’s guideline while writing a proposal, include everything
that you have done till now, include small snippets of code which you
have written preferably as Github gists. And most importantly come up
with a suitable timeline for the summer — what work will be completed
when.

Secondly, get feedback on your proposal from your seniors, friends and
the mentors of the particular project. Most of the mentors will be very
helpful and provide you with suggestions and improvements for your
proposal. Make sure to add those changes in your proposal.

--------------

After all this work sit back and wait for the results. **You have done
your part** and let destiny unfold. While waiting for the results don’t
just stop, keep in touch with the organizations, solving some minor
issues.

**PS:** This is my first blog post on Medium. Hope to write a few
more. If you have any suggestions or remarks feel free to point it out.
