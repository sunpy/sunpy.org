This short blogpost describes the journey of getting selected for Google Summer of Code, under SunPy organisation, for 2019.

What is Google Summer of Code?

**According to the sources** -


**Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university.**

For undergraduates students like us, GSoC, serves as an exciting and eventful opportunity to write software, for real world organisations, which provides the participants to write and learn the different aspects of real world programming.

Events building up to GSoC' 19
================================

Roughly, I started to prepare my case for GSoC, by choosing organisations. The organisation list is generally out by February, but many organisations, who have taken part in GSoC earlier, take part the current year also. I started to prune down my choices, and based on my interest, I chose SunPy. Since I was really fascinated with Physics, and the astronomical side of SunPy, I was quite keen to contribute to SunPy.

Working through PRs and Issues
================================


GSoC provides a really good platform to sharpen and develop skills for building Open Sourced software. While, the codebase for SunPy is present in GitHub, it was easy for me to understand and get through the process of solving issues/bugs and making a Pull Request.

I started to solve the issues and PRs for SunPy around from January, so this provided me ample time to go through the probable projects and the code base that I would work later on.

Reading codebase requires another skill, the ability to read through long scripts, understanding the flow of code and understanding the different **witch-craft** done in the codebase, and learning about them, which is what that makes up the important skill for making contributions.

Making Proposal
=================

After working through the issues and bugs, I started looking through the project ideas listed, and based on my interest, I chose NDCube. I started working on some issues of NDCube, after going through the project ideas, I chose **Supporting APE14 for NDCube**. This was quite fascinating, as it used N Dimensional cubical data structure for storing and manipulating astronomical data.

Getting selected for GSoC' 19
===============================

Even though I had a very good conversation with my mentor and the SunPy project leads, I was still quite nervous during the result day. I was watching some movies to tone out my anxiety. The moment I got my result, I was really happy, and was quite relieved.

Now the upcoming months is some thing, which I look forward to, as it remains one of my challenging months for Summers.

I have written a blogpost of my first video-chat with my mentor, so stay tuned for another blogpost of my conversation.

BTW, my mentors for the project are `Stuart Mumford <https://github.com/cadair>`_ and `Daniel Ryan. <https://github.com/DanRyanIrish>`_
