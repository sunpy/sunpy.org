# Anaconda packages are not "free"

We wanted to inform the wider community about [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and if you are legally allowed to use it for free.

What is not commonly known is that Anaconda has specific clauses in its license which determine if one is able to use it for free, based on the organization you work for.
For example, [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/08/anaconda_puts_the_squeeze_on/) has reported that:

> Research and academic organizations are just now finding out that they will have to pay for software made by Anaconda, when for years these groups were under the impression it could be used at no cost.
>
> A source who works at a medium-size non-profit academic research institution told The Register about being on the end of a legal demand to purchase a commercial license for the Anaconda-built software they had been using for free.

[Anaconda themselves summarize this in a really detailed blog post.](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/is-conda-free)
Which we use here to form the basis of this post.

## What is free to use?

- ``conda`` the package installation and environment management software, is free to use by anyone. (Also ``mamba`` the alternative to ``conda``?)

## What is not free to use?

- Anaconda's "defaults" channel, which is used for the base environment.
  A channel is similar to an app store and it is where all anaconda packages originate from when one installs a package.
  It is used if one installs the `Anaconda` distribution or the `miniconda` distribution.
  Anything that is "curated, built, maintained, and served by Anaconda's engineers on its secure cloud infrastructure", has these licenses.

Using the defaults channel can lead to you becoming legally required to pay Anaconda for the use the defaults channel.

If you want to use these for free, you have to meet the following conditions:

- Your organization has less than 200 people, or
- Your organization has 200 or more people, but qualifies as an exempt organization in Anaconda's terms of service:

> Students and educational entities may use our free offerings in curriculum-based courses.

## What is the alternative?

The answer from the SunPy Project is the following:

- Using the channels provided by "conda-forge". 
  conda-forge is a community-led project which creates recipes, hosts infrastructure and distributions for use with conda.
  They provide a distribution (similar to `miniconda`) called [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) is configured to use the conda-forge channel by default.
  It is also the only way to install any SunPy Project library via conda.
- Never setup or use the defaults channel if you install `miniforge`.

## I have Anaconda already - What should I do?

Though, you could get rid of the default channel(s) using the `conda config` command as shown [in this Stack Overflow answer about switching channels from anaconda to conda-forge](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67708768).
This is good for new environments but it doesn't remove what you've got already installed (e.g., the `base` environment) and you may be still infringing the Terms of Services for Anaconda.

Therefore, the cleanest way would be to remove Anaconda completely and install [miniforge](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/tutorial/installation.html#installing-miniforge).
Unfortunately, there is no automated way of recreating all of your environments, and [this post about migrating from Anaconda to miniforge](https://it.martinos.org/help/migrating-anaconda-miniconda-install-to-a-miniforge-install/) details the steps that one has to follow to migrate.
