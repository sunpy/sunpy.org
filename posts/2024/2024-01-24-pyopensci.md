# pyOpenSci and `sunpy`

![pyOpenSci logo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28938222?s=200&v=4)

[pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/) is a "diverse community of people interested in building a community of practice around scientific software written in Python".
They are an exciting community working on improving the information around the packaging and tooling used by the larger community as well to provide support for package maintainers.
There is a review process to become a pyOpenSci accepted package which comes with two extensive reviews from independent members of the wider community.

With this in mind, the SunPy Project decided to submit `sunpy` to pyOpenSci to ensure that it is aligned with the broader Python community that pyOpenSci is building.
The SunPy Project strives to be a useful member of the ScientiÔ¨Åc Python ecosystem and this is a good opportunity.

[The review](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission/issues/147) was started on the [pyOpenSci software-submission repository](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission).
The entire review process is open, with one editor and two reviewers and the entire exchange between the `sunpy` maintainers and the reviewers are on that issue.
This process was incredibly helpful as it pointed some miscommunication within our documentation and some choices that were made several years ago but now were redundant or not best practice.

After these issues were fixed, `sunpy` was accepted into pyOpenSci and we added the badge to the `sunpy` readme.
The plan in future is to submit more SunPy Project packages as well as integrate more closely with pyOpenSci to replace our own affiliated package system.
Our hope is that by aligning with pyOpenSci we can help to contribute back to the wider community.
