  We could always use more voices and opinions in the discussions about SunPy and its 
  development from both users and developers. You may want to suggest a new feature or 
  gripe about how something is not working how you think it should. 
  There are a number of ways to make your voice heard and we would love to hear from you. 
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy">The general mailing list</a> is a 
  great place to start. Subscribe to it and participate in the discussion.</li>
  <li>If you have technical issue about the code the 
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy-dev">developer mailing list</a> is a 
  is the place for you. This is where you can find the nitty gritty nuts and bolts discussions
  about the SunPy codebase. Subscribe to it and participate in the discussion.</li>

  <p>If you are interested in contributing fixes, code or documentation to SunPy please
  checkout our <a href="http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/dev.html">developer guide</a>.
      SunPy uses a distributed version control system called <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> and the code is hosted on 
      <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/">GitHub</a>. To get started create an account
      on <a href="https://github.com">github</a> and fork SunPy then submit your changes via a pull request.
  If you are unfamiliar with <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> and <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> our developer documentation provides a sample
  <a href="http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/dev.html#version-control">workflow</a> but you can also find lots of <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1#awesm=~opUWunJA2PgPRq">tutorials</a> online.
      Please read up on our <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/wiki/Developer-Standards">Coding Standards</a> before getting started.
      You can browse our <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues">issue list</a> or our <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/wiki/Feature-Wishlist">wishlist</a> 
  to find something that you can tackle. Please send a quick email to the dev list or stop by the chat room to let people know what you are 
      planning on working on (see the <a href="http://sunpy.org/help/">Help</a> section).

    <h1 id="proposals">SunPy Enhancement Proposals (SEP)</h1>
  </div>
  <p>If you have an idea for a major enhancement or a proposed change to SunPy please consider 
  submitting an SEP. This process is modeled after the 
  <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/">Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)</a>
  and provides a structured proposal for the SunPy community to evaluate your idea.
  You can find the 
  <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/blob/master/SEP-template.md">template</a> and 
  <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/blob/master/SEP-0001.md">more information</a> about SEPs in the appropriate 
  <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP">SunPy repository</a>.
  SEPs are submitted as pull requests into that repository.

    <h1 id="packages">Affiliated Packages</h1>
  </div>

<p> An affiliated package is a Python package related to Solar Physics that is not part of the SunPy core library,
	but can be included in the future as part of the SunPy project’s community.</p> 

<p>
As a community-driven project SunPy thus encourages contributions 
 from a diverse group of people on building such software that has the potential to be a future <b>Affiliated SunPy Package.</b></p>

<h3> Requirements to be satisfied </h3>
<ul>
  <li>The package must make use of all appropriate features in the core SunPy library, to reduce code duplication and complexity.</li>

<li>The software must provide documentation that explains the function and use of the package, 
	and this documentation should be of comparable standard to the core SunPy library.
</li>
  
<li>The code should as far as possible provide an easy to run test suite to verify the correct operation of the package.
</li>

  <li>The developers of an affiliated package should engage with the rest of the SunPy community to encourage knowledge 
	  and code sharing within the community.</li>
  </ul>

<p>	
Please look at<a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/blob/master/SEP-0004.md"> this SEP</a> 
	to read about our policies surrounding affiliated packages. Please send 
	an email to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy">mailing list</a>
  to start a dialogue.
