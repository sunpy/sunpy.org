Open review process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The review process for becoming a SunPy affiliated package is designed to be approachable, lightweight and open.
Reviews are conducted in GitHub issues through the https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy.org repository.

Steps for Getting New Packages Reviewed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If you're not sure whether to submit your package for the affiliated package review process, you can open an issue to informally discuss your package or contact the :ref:`role_affiliated-liaison` to discuss your package privately.
2. Open a new issue with the issue template.
3. The :ref:`role_affiliated-liaison` will identify a reviewer independent of your package.
4. The reviewer evaluates the affiliated package against the review criteria.
5. The reviewer adds their review as a comment to the issue.
6. The submitting author has the right to ask for another review. In this case, the :ref:`role_affiliated-liaison` will identify a new independent reviewer. This new review will be added to the same issue.
7. Based on the scores in each of the seven categories, the affiliated package is either accepted, given provisional status, or not accepted. In all three cases, this practically means closing the issue and ending the review process. In the last case, the reviewer provides the submitting author with feedback on how to meet the acceptance criteria with the intention of helping the submitting author achieve provisional or accepted status in the future.
8. If the review passed the review criteria then the submitting author or the :ref:`role_affiliated-liaison` opens a pull request to add the package and its review results to the sunpy.org website, unless the submitting author withdraws the submission.
9. The :ref:`role_affiliated-liaison` merges the pull request.

Existing Packages Review Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Existing affiliated packages will be reviewed once per year by the :ref:`role_affiliated-liaison` to ensure the review is current.
Developers may challenge a new review, which then requires the liaison to get an independent reviewer to perform the review.

Existing provisional affiliated packages will be reviewed once per year by the :ref:`role_affiliated-liaison`.
To pass they must not have a worse score and still be working towards meeting the rest of the review criteria.
