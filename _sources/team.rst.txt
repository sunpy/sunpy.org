The Project
===========

The **SunPy project** (also known as the SunPy organization) was founded and defined by `this document`_.
Its primary goal is to *facilitate and promote the use and development of a community-led, free and open-source solar data-analysis software based on the scientific Python environment*.

The organization of a board of directors, a lead developer appointed by the board, community roles and the sunpy and affiliated package developers.
Anyone is welcome to participate in the SunPy organization.
The purpose of the board is to lead the overall structure and direction of SunPy while the lead developer works with the developer community to implement it.

Members of the development community are too numerous to list here but a list of anyone who contributed code to SunPy is available on Github `contributors`_ and for
each major release we keep track of who contributed in-between `releases`_.

She received her Ph.D. in physics from Montana State University, where she began a career in satellite operations, and followed up with a NASA Postdoctoral fellowship at Goddard Space Flight Center studying flare energetics with the hard X-ray RHESSI satellite.  She now serves as the US Project Scientist for the Japanese-led Hinode mission and works to develop solar instrumentation for sounding rockets and the International Space Station.  Her research interests include observations of reconnection in the solar corona during long duration flaring events coupled with in situ complementary measurements of magnetic storms in the Earth's magnetosphere.

Affiliated Packages
===================

An affiliated package is a Python package related to Solar Physics that is not part of the SunPy core library, but can be included in the future
as part of the SunPy project’s community.

As a community-driven project SunPy thus encourages contributions from a diverse group of people on building such software that has the potential
to be a future **Affiliated SunPy Package.**

Requirements to be satisfied:

*  The package must make use of all appropriate features in the core SunPy library, to reduce code duplication and complexity.
*  The software must provide documentation that explains the function and use of the package, and this documentation should be of comparable standard to the core SunPy library.
*  The code should as far as possible provide an easy to run test suite to verify the correct operation of the package.
*  The developers of an affiliated package should engage with the rest of the SunPy community to encourage knowledge and code sharing within
   the community.

Please look at `this SEP`_ to read about our policies surrounding affiliated packages.
Please send an email to the `mailing list`_ to start a dialogue.
