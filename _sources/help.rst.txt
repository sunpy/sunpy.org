Documentation
=============

The SunPy `documentation`_ should be your first stop to get your question answered.
We strive to provide a rich and comprehensive set of docs.
The documentation is included in the code itself which you can access through `code reference`_ and we also have a number of `guides`_ which take you through specific topics.
If you do not find your answer there read on!

Mailing List
============

Sometimes the best way to get your question answered is just by asking someone.
SunPy has two mailing lists; a `general mailing list`_ for general issues and a `developer mailing list`_.
If you have a general question about how SunPy works use the main list.
The general mailing list is another way to get help with doing solar physics in Python.
If, on the other hand, you have a question about the inner workings of SunPy or how SunPy is organized or have a question about developing some new feature please use the developer mailing list.

.. _general mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy
.. _developer mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy-dev

Live Chat
=========

We have a chat room that uses `Matrix`_ which will open directly in your browser, or use the embedded client below.
Stop by and say hello.
Talk with the SunPy users and the developers and get started.

If you are using IRC hosted on `freenode`_, then you can join the same channel (bridged into matrix) by joining the (#sunpy) channel on freenode.

.. _Matrix: http://matrix.org/
.. _freenode: https://freenode.net/
